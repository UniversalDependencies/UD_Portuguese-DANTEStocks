# Summary

DANTEStocks (Di Felippo et al., 2024) is a collection of Brazilian Portuguese tweets on the stock market domain that is part of Porttinari (“PORTuguese Treebank”), which shall be a large multigenre treebank for Portuguese (Pardo et al., 2021), following the "Universal Dependencies" framework (de Marneffe et al., 2021).

# Introduction

The corpus consists of 4,042 tweets and 80,997 tokens. To annotate the corpus according to UD, the entire tweet was taken as a basic unit of analysis, which means that the tweets were not segmented into smaller units as sentences, clauses or phrases. Besides, the tweets were not normalized, containing all phenomena typical to social media text in general and to Twitter in particular. Morphosyntactic (Silva et al., 2021; Di Felippo et al., 2023) and syntactic annotations (Di Felippo et al., 2024) were carried out through alternating steps of automatic processing and manual revision.
